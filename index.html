                This level was "Dark Inferno", which later became "Level 0.666".<br>
                Basically, the door was supposed to move with the door handle but clearly it didn't work.

                The white glowing part was a pathway to a level that no longer exists named "Retray".<br>

                Jumping one year forward (due to the cancellation).<br>
                This is the new feed system, it's way better than the caption system previously that only allows one caption at a time.<br>
                I created a module that can be fed a string and duration and it outputs it into the feed.<br>
                To fix the issue on screen where you could spam objects with feedback, it only allows one of the same caption.

                This is one of the levels I actually made today(28-07-2024) called "False".<br>
                It's pretty obvious if you're a Backrooms nerd that it's Level 4.<br>
                Right now it has no windows but I took this because the lighting looked really cool.

                Also for context, "Lobby"(Level 0) is connected to Exit.
                Since you know, it's alternate,-<br> you don't have to run from anything in Exit... yet.

                When I was working on Cobalt, I didn't really know what to do for the level.<br>
                I didn't want it to be another maze level so I made so interactive parts and some references.<br>
                These aren't reference to anything but I thought of making different coloured lights through each entry.<br>
                It looks really cool with Roblox's Future lighting.
